\subsection{Bitvector Arithmetic for 32-bit Integers (with exceptions)}

\verb|src-benchmarks-roops/roops/extended/bv32|

This benchmark includes division and remainder.
However, for division and remainder operations, a helper method must be used 
to accomodate for varying semantics of the different target languages.
See \refsection{RoopsLibrary}. A tool can treat it as an intrinsic operation
to avoid having to reason inter-procedurally.
