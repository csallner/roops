\subsection{Bitvector Arithmetic for 32-bit Integers (with exceptions)}

This benchmark includes division and remainder.
However, for division and remainder operations, a helper method must be used 
to accomodate for varying semantics of the different target languages.
See \refsection{RoopsLibrary}. A tool can treat it as an intrinsic operation
to avoid having to reason inter-procedurally.

            if (RoopsInt32.Divide(x, y) == z)
                { /*$goal 0 */}
            else
                { /*$goal 1*/}
